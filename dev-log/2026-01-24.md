# Dev log 2026-01-24

## Progress
- Verified the Saga crawler output via `kikidoko-crawl --source saga --dry-run` to confirm the existing table parser still collects manufacturer/model/location links correctly.
- Tightened table header handling so RIKEN’s list now maps the "機器・施設名"/"分類"/"管轄先" columns instead of falling back to the generic `category_hint`/empty addresses.
- Added whitespace-stripping inside `normalize_label` and taught the location keywords to recognize "管轄" headers, then reran `kikidoko-crawl --source riken --dry-run` to ensure the new labels capture real category names and location strings.
- Updated `scrape-status/2026-01-18-scraping-status.md` to mark RIKEN as completed.
- Added a Shimane University scraper for `https://www.shimane-u.org/kiki.htm`, parsing the shared equipment tables (including rowspan categories) and preserving model + location data.
- Added a Shinshu University scraper for `https://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/institution/kiban/kiki/secchi/`, extracting equipment names, models, categories, and locations from the equipment detail tables.
- Marked Shimane/Shinshu as completed and removed Saitama from the "未完了" list after confirming the public equipment list is not accessible.
- Added a Tokyo Tech crawler for the shared equipment search table, capturing names, categories, location/affiliation, external-use hints, and contact links.
- Added a TUAT crawler for the instrument facility site, collecting instrument pages from the index and extracting names, locations, contact details, and fee notes.
- Verified the TMDU table list still scrapes correctly and marked Tokyo Tech/TMDU/TUAT as completed.
- Added a Tottori University crawler using the public “共同利用設備” WP API, extracting categories, locations, and manufacturer/model details from each detail page.
- Added a Toyohashi University of Technology crawler for the analysis/engineering shared equipment lists, capturing equipment names and locations where available.
- Marked Tottori/Toyohashi as completed and moved Toyama to the excluded list because no public HTML equipment list is available (policy PDFs only).
- Added a Tsukuba University crawler that iterates the public search results, follows detail pages, and captures department/category/location + fee data.
- Added a UEC crawler using the public WP API (category: 設備紹介) to extract maker/model, manager, and location data.
- Marked Tsukuba/UEC as completed and moved Ryukyus to excluded because the public site returns HTTP 403.

## Notes
- RIKEN’s table uses spaced headers (e.g., "分　類"), so the extra whitespace removal is what allowed `_map_headers` to resolve the correct columns.
- The RIKEN detail column still mixes center names with action links; the parser now stores that text in `address_raw`, so `prefecture`/`org_type` can still be deduced from the common org name.
- Saitama’s public center site links to an internal equipment list that returns HTTP 403, so it remains excluded per the "公開ページに機器一覧が見当たらない" rule.
- Ryukyus’ equipment portal (rfc.lab.u-ryukyu.ac.jp) responds with HTTP 403 from public networks, so it is excluded per the login/restriction policy.

## Validation
- Saga dry run: 103 records, with manufacturer/model/contact + detail URLs preserved.
- RIKEN dry run: 26 records now include the actual category text (not just the fallback) and carry the location column as `address_raw`.
- Shimane dry run: 36 records from the shared equipment tables.
- Shinshu dry run: 8 records from the Matsumoto equipment list page.
- Tokyo Tech dry run: 791 records from the shared equipment search table.
- TMDU dry run: 67 records from the shared equipment list page.
- TUAT dry run: 13 records from the instrument facility site.
- Tottori dry run: 212 records from the joint-use equipment catalog.
- Toyohashi dry run: 47 records from the shared equipment lists.
- Tsukuba dry run: 239 records from the openfacility list/detail pages.
- UEC dry run: 34 records from the equipment introduction posts.

## Next steps
- Continue working down the "未完了" list (next targets: Utsunomiya, Yamaguchi, Yamanashi) while respecting the PDF/login exclusion policy.
