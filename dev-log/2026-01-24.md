# Dev log 2026-01-24

## Progress
- Verified the Saga crawler output via `kikidoko-crawl --source saga --dry-run` to confirm the existing table parser still collects manufacturer/model/location links correctly.
- Tightened table header handling so RIKEN’s list now maps the "機器・施設名"/"分類"/"管轄先" columns instead of falling back to the generic `category_hint`/empty addresses.
- Added whitespace-stripping inside `normalize_label` and taught the location keywords to recognize "管轄" headers, then reran `kikidoko-crawl --source riken --dry-run` to ensure the new labels capture real category names and location strings.
- Updated `scrape-status/2026-01-18-scraping-status.md` to mark RIKEN as completed.
- Added a Shimane University scraper for `https://www.shimane-u.org/kiki.htm`, parsing the shared equipment tables (including rowspan categories) and preserving model + location data.
- Added a Shinshu University scraper for `https://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/institution/kiban/kiki/secchi/`, extracting equipment names, models, categories, and locations from the equipment detail tables.
- Marked Shimane/Shinshu as completed and removed Saitama from the "未完了" list after confirming the public equipment list is not accessible.

## Notes
- RIKEN’s table uses spaced headers (e.g., "分　類"), so the extra whitespace removal is what allowed `_map_headers` to resolve the correct columns.
- The RIKEN detail column still mixes center names with action links; the parser now stores that text in `address_raw`, so `prefecture`/`org_type` can still be deduced from the common org name.
- Saitama’s public center site links to an internal equipment list that returns HTTP 403, so it remains excluded per the "公開ページに機器一覧が見当たらない" rule.

## Validation
- Saga dry run: 103 records, with manufacturer/model/contact + detail URLs preserved.
- RIKEN dry run: 26 records now include the actual category text (not just the fallback) and carry the location column as `address_raw`.
- Shimane dry run: 36 records from the shared equipment tables.
- Shinshu dry run: 8 records from the Matsumoto equipment list page.

## Next steps
- Continue working down the "未完了" list (next targets: Saitama exclusion review, Shimane, Shinshu) while respecting the PDF/login exclusion policy.
