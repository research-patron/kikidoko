While bacterial engraftment and recovery of microbial diversity are central to FMT efficacy, accumulating evidence suggests that host immune reprogramming is involved. In murine models, regulatory CD4⁺ T cells are indispensable for clearing C. difficile . To address this mechanistic gap, we examined systemic immune…",10.1080/2162402x.2025.2605741,Single-cell landscape of peripheral and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in HPV-negative HNSCC,2026,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, arising in diverse upper airway mucosal niches, is particularly aggressive, with poor 5-y survival and a limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. A deeper understanding of the tumor-localized immune landscape is essential to uncover actionable immunotherapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from 29 samples totaling nearly 300,00…"

On the one hand, there is a lack of efficient band gap correction method for density functional theory that is suitable for these materials in both crystalline and amorphous phases, while maintaining the computational complexity comparable to local density approximation. On the other hand, analysis of the coordination number in amorphous phases relies on an integration involvi…",10.1038/s41467-025-67062-3,Complexity of quantum tomography from genuine non-Gaussian entanglement,2026,"Quantum state tomography typically requires exponentially many copies of a quantum state, due to the complex correlations present in large systems. We show that, for bosonic systems, the scaling is completely determined by the nature of these correlations. Motivated by the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and boson sampling, we define Gaussian-entanglable (GE) states, produced by generalized interference between separable bosonic modes. GE states greatly extend the Gaussian family, encompassing separable…",10.1186/s44149-025-00211-9,Construction and immunogenicity of a recombinant pseudorabies virus expressing the G protein of Nipah virus in mice,2026,"Abstract Nipah virus disease, caused by Nipah virus (NiV), is a zoonotic infectious disease with an extremely high fatality rate. Owing to the absence of effective countermeasures, Nipah virus disease has caused substantial economic losses in the swine farming industry. Vaccines represent the most cost-effective approach for prevention and control. Herein, we describe the development of a recombinant pseudorabies virus (PRV)-vectored vaccine (designated PRV-HNX-ΔTK/gE-NiV-G), which expresses th…"

It tackles the strategic challenge faced by destinations that have historically invested in tourism growth but now must reduce visitors without harming economic stability or brand identity. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual, theory-building study based on a critical review and abductive synthesis of the literature.

When the sample was further crushed to under 1 mm and reprocessed, a concentrate with 66.7% iron content and 95.88% metal recovery was obtained.
